A series of small shader projects I did to learn how to create shaders. This readme file does not cover every shader that I created but it should give you an idea of what I have been working on.

Shader 1 : Mandelbrot set shader

Shader 2 : Scribble shader using vertex displacement

Shader 3 : Inverse/distortion shader to create a timestop effect

Shader 4 : Scan shader using a depth buffer

Shader 5 : Stencil buffer shader

Shader 6 : Toon/outline shader with noise to replicate an effect seen in Mario Strikers
